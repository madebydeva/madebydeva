- 👋 Hi, I’m @madebydeva
- 👀 I’m interested in creating games, making art, and having fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning game development on Godot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning projects mostly, since I don't know enough to contribute to anything bigger yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... still deciding lmao.
